# telicom-churn-solution
Objective:
To  predict the churn for a relicom dataset based on different features.
Process:
 Bussiness understanding, EDA, model building, accuracy of the model.
 
 Structure of the project
 1)dataset
 2)model python file
 
 Description :
The dataset contains x variable(different features to predict classification of churn in telecom industry)and a y variable(churn classification), Performed EDA on the dataset to get better understanding of each column, the relationship between each column,and comparison between each column, next we started with model building applied different algorithm such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest ,and finally checked with the accuracy of the model.
